and finally deploy containers with kubernetes.
2. compile Spring app to native images using Spring Native and GraalVM, use them in serverless architectures
3. deploy on a serverless platform built on top of kubernetes with Knative.
4. GitOps and Argo CD.

# Part 2 Cloud Native Development
Main practices and patterns for building production-ready cloud native apps.

## Getting started with cloud native development
1. Bootstrapping a cloud native project
2. Working with embedded servers and Tomcat
3. Building a RESTful application with Spring MVC
4. Testing a RESTful application with Spring Test
5. Automating the build and tests with GitHub Actions

## Bootstrapping a cloud native project
### One codebase, one application
